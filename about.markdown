# Hi there!, I'm Adebowale Odufuwa
From a foundation rooted in sales, customer service, and leadership within the Telecoms, Banking, and Manufacturing sectors, I have spent the past decade excelling at driving growth, enhancing customer satisfaction, and leading high-performing teams. My career began with hands-on experiences where I honed my ability to communicate effectively across diverse audiences and manage challenging environments with resilience. These roles enabled me to develop an intuitive understanding of business dynamics and fostered my adaptability in an ever-changing professional landscape.

Midway through my career, I embraced my passion for innovation and problem-solving, stepping into roles that required a deeper analytical approach. Notably, during my tenure at Globacom, I led strategic initiatives that boosted regional sales from ₦700 million to over ₦1.1 billion in just a year. My commitment to excellence was recognized with two consecutive "Most Outstanding Staff" awards. These experiences underscored my interest in utilizing data and technology to drive informed business decisions.

Now, as I pivot into the world of data analytics and business intelligence, my journey has come full circle. My recent academic accomplishments, including an MSc in Business Analytics, equipped me with technical proficiencies in Python, SQL, Tableau, and Power BI, among others. In my role as a Data Engagement Analyst with Aberdeen Cyrenians, I’ve applied these skills to optimize systems, enhance decision-making processes, and design insightful dashboards that have driven impactful organizational change.

What makes me unique is my ability to blend technical expertise with exceptional interpersonal and leadership skills. My passion for data analytics is deeply connected to my love for storytelling—whether through cinematic narratives or data visualization. I believe every dataset has a story to tell, and my mission is to unlock insights that can drive meaningful action. My commitment to mentorship and community outreach further reflects my belief in collaboration and the power of shared growth, which translates into every project I undertake.

If you're seeking a data-driven professional who combines analytical expertise with a human-centered approach, let's connect. I’m eager to bring my unique blend of skills to a dynamic team in a Business Intelligence or Data Analyst role.
